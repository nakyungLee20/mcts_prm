For every \\( 1 \\le i \\le n \\), there are at most \\( m \\) indices \\( k \\) with \\( x_{ik} = \\max\\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ik}\\} \\).\n3. For every \\( 1 \\le j \\le n \\), there are at most \\( m \\) indices \\( k \\) with \\( x_{kj} = \\max\\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \\ldots, x_{kj}\\} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Constraints\n- Each element \\( x_{ij} \\) is either the maximum of the elements in its row up to that position or the maximum of the elements in its column up to that position.\n- Each row and each column can have at most \\( m \\) elements that are the maximum in their respective rows or columns.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a Matrix\nConsider a matrix where each row and each column has exactly one element that is the maximum in its row and exactly one element that is the maximum in its column. This can be achieved by placing the maximum elements along the main diagonal of the matrix.\n\nFor example, for \\( n = 3 \\):\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nHere, each element on the diagonal is the maximum in its row and the maximum in its column.\n\n### Step 4: Generalizing for Any \\( n \\)\nFor any \\( n \\times n \\) matrix, we can place the maximum elements along the main diagonal. This ensures that each row and each column has exactly one maximum element.\n\n### Step 5: Determining \\( m \\)\nSince each row and each column has exactly one maximum element, the maximum number of indices \\( k \\) for which \\( x_{ik} = \\max\\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ik}\\} \\) or \\( x_{kj} = \\max\\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \\ldots, x_{kj}\\} \\) is \\( n \\).\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\( m \\) that satisfies all the given conditions is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n}\n\\]",
